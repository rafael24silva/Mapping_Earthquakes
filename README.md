# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this analysis is to add to the pervious earthquake map we had built. We added a tectonic plate overlay that displays the plate lines throughout the world. We have also added another overlay that displays all of the recent major earthquakes color-coded depending on their magnitude.  that have happened. We also added a third map style.
